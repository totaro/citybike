Let's imagine that you have received an interesting project offer to create a UI and a backend service for displaying data from journeys made with city bikes in the Helsinki Capital area.

The exercise uses data that is owned by City Bike Finland. We provide database to you in a Docker container, but the original datasets can be downloaded from here:
The exercise
Create a web application that uses a backend service to fetch the data. Backend can be made with any technology. We at X use for example (not in preference order) Java/Kotlin/C#/TypeScript but you are free to choose any other technology as well.
You are provided with Docker setup, with contains a PostgreSQL database with all the necessary data for the exercise.
You can also freely choose the frontend technologies to use. The important part is to give good instructions on how to build and run the project.<br>
